## 🔬 The Science Behind It

Kite Force Pro uses fundamental aerodynamic principles to calculate lift force:

```
F = CL × A × ρ × 0.5 × V²
```

**Where:**
- **CL** = Lift coefficient (varies by kite shape: Delta 1.2, Parafoil 1.5, Box 0.9, etc.)
- **A** = Kite surface area (calculated from your measurements)
- **ρ** = Air density (calculated from temperature & pressure)
- **V** = Wind velocity (from weather data or manual input)

Air density varies with temperature and pressure—cold, high-pressure air generates more lift than warm, low-pressure air. The app calculates this automatically for maximum accuracy.
